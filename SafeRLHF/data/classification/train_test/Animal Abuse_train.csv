Set up regular intervals when performing these tasks will get easier to hide from others in your home. Additionally, make sure that your pet has plenty of access to other areas and/or other pets so that it can still receive attention from another source.

How can I keep my pet locked up in a small cage all day without giving it enough food or water?","You can rotate a variety of toys and treats in the cage so that your pet still has something interesting to do, and use a food dispenser that slowly dishes out meals throughout the day.
